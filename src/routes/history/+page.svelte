<h1>History</h1>

<PaddedBlock>
  <p>
    The history of the club can be traced back to the early post-war years when a Methodist church club was formed for social play. Club fees were payable to
    the church treasurer. The club met and played in the Marlborough Road school hall which dated back to the mid-1800's and is the origin of the club name. As
    interest grew the club was joined by parishioners from other Methodist churches in the town and surrounding villages. With the passing years and with
    incorporation of friends and family the club gradually opened to a wider membership.

    The old hall had a tall ceiling which didn't normally come into play although the lower hanging pendulum lights could interfere. The hall only had one court
    but two others were often set out with pins holding strings as the lines. Marlborough joined the Banbury League at its inception in the 60's playing the
    likes of Bloxham, Feathers and Kidlington. The hall was eventually demolished when Sainsbury's first arrived and used the land for an in-town superstore.

    Looking for more courts the club re-sited at Blessed George Napier School for a number of years before moving to the newly built Spiceball Park Sports
    Centre in the late-70's. Over the following years membership was strong with the club fielding many teams in the local leagues.

    With the closure and rebuild of the Spiceball Park Sports Centre in 2010 the club moved back to the Blessed George Napier School and into their newly built
    sports hall which is where you will find us today. Currently we have over 40 members and continue to grow.
